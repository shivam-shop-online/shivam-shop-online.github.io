Add this to the \`sections\` object in \`config.json\` and include the section's \`id\` in the \`orderOfSectionsInHeader\` array to display it on your landing page.

### Special Sections
The \`specialSections\` object defines additional pages:
- \`allPublications\`: Displays all your publications
- \`phdThesis\`: Links to your PhD thesis
- \`documentation\`: This help page

### Section Order
The \`orderOfSectionsInHeader\` array determines the order of sections in the navigation menu.

## 2. Adding New Publications

1. Open your BibTeX file (specified in \`bibtexPath\`).
2. Add a new entry using this format:

   \`\`\`bibtex
   @article{PublicationId,
     author = {Author, A. and Author, B.},
     title = {Title of the Article},
     journal = {Journal Name},
     year = {2023},
     volume = {1},
     number = {1},
     pages = {1--10},
     doi = {10.1000/xyz123},
     abstract = {Brief summary of the paper.},
     url = {https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123},
     image = {image.jpg},
     paperurl = {paper.pdf},
     code = {https://github.com/yourusername/project},
     video = {https://youtube.com/watch?v=videoID},
     slides = {slides.pdf},
     github = {https://github.com/yourusername/project},
     demo = {https://demo-url.com},
     awards = {Best Paper Award},
     shorturl = {short-url-for-paper},
     markdown = {markdown-file.md}
   }
   \`\`\`

   Note: 
   - All fields after \`abstract\` are optional. Include them only if relevant to your publication.
   - \`image\`, \`paperurl\`, and \`slides\` paths should mention just the file name in folder of the respective publication \`public/publications/PublicationId/\`.
   - The \`markdown\` field, if provided, the content of this Markdown file will be included in the publication details page.

3. Save the BibTeX file.
4. To feature this publication, add its citation key to \`featuredPublications\` in \`config.json\`.
5. Place any associated files (PDF, images) in \`public/publications/PublicationId/\`.
6. Upload all modified files to your web server.

After uploading, refresh your website to see the changes. No rebuild is needed for new publications.

## 3. Adding Markdown Content to Publications

To add detailed Markdown content to a publication:

1. Create a Markdown file for your publication (e.g., \`publicationDetails.md\`).
2. Place this file in the same directory as other publication files (\`public/publications/PublicationId/\`).
3. Add a \`markdown\` field to your BibTeX entry, pointing to this file:
4. The content of this Markdown file will now appear on the publication's detail page.

## 4. Troubleshooting

If changes don't appear:
1. Clear your browser cache and reload.
2. Verify all files are uploaded to the correct locations.
3. Check file paths in BibTeX entries.
4. If you changed React components or source code, rebuild and redeploy the website.

For the richest publication pages, include as much information as possible in your BibTeX entries and utilize the Markdown feature for detailed content.

## 5. Easy Deployment with GitHub Pages

To make it easy to deploy your website after making changes to \`config.json\` or adding new publications, follow these steps:

### Initial Setup (one-time process)

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Go to your forked repository's settings.
3. Navigate to "Pages" under "Code and automation" in the left sidebar.
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" from the dropdown menu.

The deployment workflow file (\`.github/workflows/deploy.yml\`) is already included in the repository, so you don't need to create it manually.

### Verifying Build Directory

The workflow is configured to use \`./dist\` as the publish directory. If your project uses a different build output directory:

### Deploying Changes

After the initial setup, deploying changes is simple:

1. Make your desired changes to \`config.json\` or add new publications to your BibTeX file.
2. Commit and push these changes to the \`main\` branch of your GitHub repository.
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your website.
4. Wait a few minutes, then visit your GitHub Pages URL to see the changes live.

This process allows you to update your website directly through GitHub's web interface:

1. Navigate to your \`config.json\` file in your GitHub repository.
2. Click the edit (pencil) icon.
3. Make your changes.
4. At the bottom of the page, add a commit message describing your changes.
5. Click "Commit changes".

Your website will automatically update with the new changes.

Note: The first time you push changes, it may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to set up. Subsequent updates should be quicker.

If you encounter any issues or your changes don't appear after a few minutes, check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for any error messages.
